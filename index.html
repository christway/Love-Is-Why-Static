        <p style="margin-top: 0;">We don’t do something unless we have a reason for doing it. The reason why we do what we do is simple… love.</p>        
        <p>Jesus came to us as our Savior, died on the cross to extinguish our sin, and rose again in power over death because of his love for us! That great love is why we chose everyday to love God and to love others. Love is why.</p>
        <p>Because we’re fueled by love, we don’t live under a fear that makes us feel that we have to be perfect and we won’t stand for others to live under that fear either. Grounded in Truth, we’re honest about who we are and who we want to be while giving ourselves and others grace in the in-between. Everything that we do begins and ends with love.</p>
        <p>At ChristWay church, we are who we are because Jesus is who He is. The Love Is Why movement is really all about him, and we’d rather be known by Jesus’ name than any other name both here in Chattanooga and around the world. Love is why.</p>

                <p>Panama City is our home away from home for the past 26 years (vacation every year there).  So, I thought how I can show them the love all the way from Harrison, TN without going down there? I’m on all the social media pages for PCB, I listen to the radio station & I read the paper (online).. What could I do? I thought about the gift cards that I have been carrying around in my purse (yes, I know I need to use them but I just forget about them)....</p> 
                <p>I messaged someone on one of the social media pages, she is in the process of collecting items for some of the elderly and school-aged children.  I told her about my gift-cards, along with the Love is Why cards, and I wanted to know if I could mail them to her.  She said, “Absolutely,”  and asked if I want her to post something about who sent them?  Nope, just tell them Love is Why. It’s not about telling them who did, it’s about telling them that, while they are in this storm (literally from the hurricane), that our Heavenly Father loves them.</p>

                <p>I'm an avid blood donor but, in the last 2 years, I wasn't able to donate due to pregnancy and nursing our son.  Now that he's older I really hadn't put much thought into going to do it...until I received a phone call Blood Assurance. The reason for the call is that my blood has antibodies that a child in the hospital is in current need of. The child was terribly ill and my heart ached for that family. The next morning I got up, drank extra water and prepared to take the kids to school--two-hour delay days are awesome for me because I can get things accomplished!</p> 
                <p>I packed up my two youngest kids and we went to Blood Assurance. My iron has constantly been a struggle so I forewarned the technician to start there before we got too far. First stick on left hand...12.3; that’s not high enough because I needed a 12.5. I'm not discouraged, and I asked them to let me  pray about this because there is a child that needs my blood, and they are going to get it. “Lord, please let this next stick be at least 12.5 because this baby needs this blood more than I do right now and I want to give it to them.” Last stick...13.3!! I was so happy; let's get this donation started! I was glad that I, simple me, could be of service to someone else. Why was I so overjoyed to do this? Love is why.</p>

                <p>This past week I had to tell one of my patients and his wife that he has metastatic cancer. After sharing the news, in conversation I asked if he and his family were in church and knew Jesus. He replied with “no, but I’ve been thinking about that for the past couple of days.” I got to share Jesus’ love with he and his wife then pray for them in the exam room. I told them about a sermon I wanted them to watch and He promised they would.</p> 
                <p>Of course I had no Love is Why cards with me when I needed them but came home and ordered Craig Groeschel’s new book called “Hope in the Dark: Believing God is Good When Life is Not,” and had it sent to their house with a Love is Why card. I’m thankful for the opportunity to provide care and love on this family, and ask for continued prayers for them during this difficult time and most of all for a relationship with Christ.</p>

                <p>Last night, I was in the drive through at Starbucks in Cleveland. I was with two of my friends, and, when we got to the window to pay for our order, he handed us this card and told us the car in front of us paid for our drinks. We were all three amazed and so appreciative of the generosity this person showed.</p> 
                <p>It was a little touch from heaven because what this person doesn't know is that I have struggled with depression and PTSD this past year and have been in a pretty dark place again recently. I've needed God to show me that He is working even when it feels like my world around me is crashing. So, thank you for being the hands and feet of Christ and listening to a prompting to pay for our drinks tonight because you paid for so much more than that!</p>

                <p>Today, we were surprised by our whole meal being paid for at Texas Roadhouse! We all know it is very expensive, and on the bill it said “love is why.” Also a random stranger gave my little brother $10 for his birthday present. It made my family very happy that there is still hope in this world!</p>
